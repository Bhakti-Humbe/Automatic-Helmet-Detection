# 🚀 Automatic Helmet Detector using CNN  

## 📌 Introduction  
Motorcycle accidents have been increasing rapidly worldwide due to the negligence of road safety rules. In India, wearing a helmet is mandatory for riders, but the rule is often ignored, leading to severe accidents and fatalities.  

To address this issue, we developed **"Automatic Helmet Detector using CNN"**, an AI-based system that detects riders without helmets and can automatically send a fine notification. This project is a step toward enhancing road safety through technology.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✅ Detects whether a motorcycle rider is wearing a helmet using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
✅ Real-time detection using **image/video processing**  
✅ Can be integrated with traffic surveillance systems  

## 📂 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV  
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset for helmet detection  

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automatic-Helmet-Detector.git
   cd Automatic-Helmet-Detector
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the detection script:  
   ```bash
   python detect_helmet.py
   ```  

## 🔬 How It Works  
1. The system captures an image/video frame.  
2. A **CNN model** processes the image to detect the presence of a helmet.    
3. The system can be integrated with **traffic cameras** for real-time monitoring.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Improve detection accuracy using a larger dataset.  
- Integrate with **license plate recognition** for automated fine issuance.  
- Deploy as a **web-based application** for traffic authorities.
